# juxtapose - Creating Interactive Before-After Pictures on theÂ Web
Using JuxtaposeJS to display Nyphenburg and its castle across different seasons.

Have you ever wondered how online publications do these fancy image slider overlays for before-after pictures ([example](https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/berlin-1945-2015/))? 
I did too, so I did some research and came across [JuxtaposeJS](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/juxtapose), a free and simple library to create easy-to-make frame comparisons. For a full write up on how to create your own juxtapose check out the [Medium article] or take a look at the hosted version of my example [here](http://maienschein.me/juxtapose/).
